# About Me

<img src="images\photo\photo2.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Nan Yan (Èó´Ê•†)**.<br>

I am a second-year graduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Wuhan University (WHU), advised by [<font color="#428bca">Prof. Yuqing Li</font>](https://liyuqingwhu.github.io/lyq/), within [<font color="#428bca">Data Security Lab</font>](https://datasec.whu.edu.cn/). I also work closely with [<font color="#428bca">Prof. Jing Chen</font>](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/info/1101/1784.htm) and [<font color="#428bca">Prof. Xiong Wang</font>](https://wangxionghome.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree in School of Computer Science and Engineering from Shandong University (SDU) in 2023.

My research interests lie in **Trustworthy AI**, with a particular focus on studying the security, safety, and privacy of machine learning systems. I work on developing innovative solutions for privacy-preserving federated learning, and I am especially interested in emerging challenges in the security of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents.

Outside the digital realm, I channel my energy into üèäswimming and üí™fitness.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at  üì¨<font color="#428bca">nanyan [at] whu [dot] edu [dot] cn</font> 

üìå**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2026 Fall admission. If you have any information, please contact me. Thank you!</font>**

## Research Interests

- **Security of generative AI and LLM agents**: Exploring the security of large language models (LLMs), including backdoor attacks, jailbreak techniques, and emerging threats in LLM-powered agents.
- **Privacy**: Investigating the use of Differential Privacy (DP) in the fine-tuning of LLMs to enhance privacy guarantees.
- **Federated Learning**: Enhancing the efficiency and robustness of federated learning systems, with a focus on privacy-preserving techniques such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and DP.
